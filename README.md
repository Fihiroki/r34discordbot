# r34discordbot
(Part of) a discord bot that pulls images from rule34 and posts them.

This would be the entirety of the bot, but im still working on that bit. So, yeah.

Feel free to use it.

# Requirements
Python 3.8

# Usage
1. Open your console (Command prompt or Terminal, what have you.)
2. Navigate to the folder which the .py file is located
3. run either through `py r34discordbot.py -t <tags>` or `r34discordbot.py -t <tags>`

`-t` supplies your tags for the rule34 search, for example, `-t furry sound`
There is actively no special character filter, so if you were to enter `-t furry,sound` your query would be denied. Only use spaces.
